There is no real need to use / install lighttpd since apache can handle all the requirements, and the framework automated the managenent of ".htaccess" files.

I used lighttpd in console app mode when I did not realize yet that starting vscode as root was the solution to debug (attach) to the apache webserver.

The following are instructions in case someone would really want to use lighttpd instead of Apache.

If Apache is also installed, ensure the service is off
    $ systemctl --type=service | grep apache     # To see if Apache is running
    $ sudo service apache2 stop

Installing lighttpd   Reference: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/lighttpd
    $ sudo apt-get install lighttpd
    $ sudo service lighttpd stop
    $ sudo apt-get install gamin             # On Lubuntu this was needed to fix a bug

#Running lighttpd as a Console Application  (LATER)
    $ sudo lighttpd -D -f ~/lighttpd.conf
    # use CTRL+SHIFT+C to break	

Since lighttpd is started as root, to be able to debug using VSCODE, it also has to be started as root, since the "attach" debug mode need to find the process running under root level.
    $ sudo code --user-data-dir="~/.vscode-root"
    All the VSCODE extensions will need to be installed under the root account.
    Then open the echo linux workspace example

$ sudo lighttpd -D -f ~/lighttpd.conf

The following will work with lighttpd
    http://localhost/echo.fcgi

In case of access rights issues:
    $ chmod -R a+rwx /etc/Harbour_FastCGI
    $ chmod -R a+rwx /etc/Harbour_websites
