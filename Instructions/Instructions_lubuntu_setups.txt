Setting up IDE for Harbour, VSCODE
==================================

Optional to install Fira Mono font:

https://fonts.google.com/?query=fira+mono&selection.family=Fira+Mono
	Download to Desktop for example, folder "Fira_Mono", unzip, then will use "Font Manager" that we are going to install.


Install Font  "Fira Mono"  (My font used in VSCodium/VSCODE)
	Install Font Manager
		sudo apt install -y font-manager
		In the "File Manager" Right click on the .ttf files (one at a time) and "Open With" "Font Viewer". 
		Once in the Viewer use the "Install Font" button.
		
For additional information: https://itsfoss.com/install-fonts-ubuntu/


Install https://vscodium.com/

	#Create a folder that will be used the the "Local History" extension
	sudo mkdir /etc/VSCode_History
	sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/VSCode_History


	New method to install VSCODE:
		sudo snap install --classic code # or code-insiders


	Start VSCodium from the "start menu" under the "Programming" menu and install the same extensions and settings as the once set under  Windows.

		Install VSCode Extensions
			Required:
				Harbour and xHarbour (Antonino Perricone)
				Tasks (actboy168)
			Optional:
				Kai Light (Alek Angelov)
				Local History (xyz)
				Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 (coenraads)
				Code Spell Checker (streetsidesoftware)
				Cursor Align (Mike Moore)
				filesize (Matheus Kautzmann)
				HTML Preview (Thomas Haakon Townsend)

				Bookmarks (Alessandro Fragnani)



Optional settings:
==================
Update the preferences in featherpad, see print screens

Simplify Password Requirement
	http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2015/06/minimum-password-length-ubuntu/
		$ sudo featherpad /etc/pam.d/common-password
			Change line "password     [success=1 default=ignore]    pam_unix.so obscure sha512"
			to          "password     [success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so	sha512	minlen=3"               USE TABS as separators


Change PCManFM-Qt setting to default view to details, show hidden, show filter, Terminal to "qterminal", see print screens
	Had to make same changes for "run as root" mode


Anytime Check for Updates
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt upgrade

Add command aliases to have Windows Commands (DOS)
	$ featherpad ~/.bashrc      and past the following lines at the bottom
		alias dir="ls -ls"
		alias e="exit"
		alias md="mkdir"
		alias del="rm"
		alias rd="rmdir"
		alias n="featherpad"


To Add icons on the task bar:
First make a "Shortcuts" folder on the desktop, then by dragging from the menu make some shortcuts and move then in that new folder. 
Then drap out of the "Shortcuts" folder icons to the task bar, in the area "Quick Launch". 
DO NOT DELETE OR MOVE the shortcuts in the "Shortcuts folder!"
To learn more options use right click on the "Start" button on the bottom panel.
It is also possible to add extra pannels.

Configure and install apps for web development.
===============================================

Edit local dns host file. Add "localsandbox" and "echo" to use 127.0.0.1
	sudo featherpad /etc/hosts
		Add the following lines:
			127.0.0.1  echo
			127.0.0.1  localsandbox

To test if host file worked, using the ping command. To stop the command use CTRL+SHIFT+C or CTRL+C (depending of settings)
	ping echo

Get the Harbour_FastCGI and Harbour_VFP repos in a ~/GitHub folder.   "~" means home folder (specific to logged in user).

	mkdir ~/GitHub
	cd ~/GitHub
	git clone https://github.com/EricLendvai/Harbour_FastCGI.git
	git clone https://github.com/EricLendvai/Harbour_VFP.git
	git clone https://github.com/EricLendvai/Harbour_ORM.git

	$ sudo mkdir /etc/Harbour_FastCGI
	$ sudo mkdir /etc/Harbour_websites
	$ sudo mkdir /etc/Harbour_ORM
	$ sudo mkdir /etc/Harbour_VFP
	
	$ sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/Harbour_FastCGI
	$ sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/Harbour_websites
	$ sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/Harbour_ORM
	$ sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/Harbour_VFP

	Copy files and folder from ~/GitHub/EricLendvai/Harbour_* folders to /etc/Harbour_*  
	ENSURE YOU CAN COPY HIDDEN FOLDERS, since ".vscode" is hidden.
	You can remove the mingw64 and msvc folders since system will generate gcc folder.
	Future version will have "windows" and "linux" sub folder to make it easier to separate compiled files.

See other instruction for Apache




    $ sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/Harbour_FastCGI
    Ensure VSCode is closed. Computer will crash is VSCODE is one as current user and root at the same time.
    $ sudo code --user-data-dir="~/.vscode-root"
    Open Workspace /etc/Harbour_FastCGI/Examples/echo/fcgi-echo_linux.code-workspace
    Open file hb_fcgi/BuildEXE.sh and ensure the line termination is LF not CRLF 
      (Click in lower right, on CRLF, to switch to LF)
    Use the <CompileRelease> button
